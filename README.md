# Image-Processing-using-Fast-Fourier-Transform
## Goal
Implementaion of 2D fast fourier transform in image processing. The attributes extracted from spatial frequency plane would be used to refine and modify the original image.Image sharpening and denoising is also performed using gaussian and butterworth filters on low and high pass filters in fourier domain. The project is under progress.
